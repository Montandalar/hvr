<h2>Final Evaluation with Respect to the Project's Impact on the Individual, Society and the Environment</h2>

<h3>Impact on the Individual: The Player and the Developer</h3>
<p>The intended impact on <strong>the player</strong> is to entertain. The player is invited to participate in the gamemode as an enjoyable use of their time, and with little time commitment. A player can join a game for only one round and is not obligated to stay for any period of time, though they should stay for at least one full round. Thus, the gamemode is quick to play, which may suit the time commitments of some players. This is in contrast to other gamemodes available that require a large time commitment. On the other hand, the gamemode could potentially take place ove a variety of maps that increase the longevity of play sessions.</p>
<p>The gamemode is best suited to a <strong>group of players</strong> who are familiar with each other and the rules of the server. Otherwise, if the gamemode is played with strangers on the internet, they may be more critical of the player and hold their actions against them. This problem is not unique to HvR by any means, but occurs in nearly any online game.</p>
<p>By making the MDP, <strong>the designer/developer</strong> gained skills in scripting using lua for Garry's Mod. This experience not only applies to coding within the framework of Garry's Mod, but also built general skills in programming. The MDP taught the designer about event-based programming using the available <code>hooks</code> in Garry's Mod. Another concept the was learned was the use of object-oriented programming in lua so that an entity can reference itself but from within generic code.</p>

<h3>Impact on Society: Groups of Players and Server Operators</h3>
<p>Humans versus Robots would be a useless design without groups of willing players. Furthermore, in order to service these players, <strong>Server Operators</strong> must be willing to host a server which runs the gamemode. The burden of the server host to pay for running the server is an issue in any game for which community-run servers exist. Most community servers rely on donations to keep running.</p>
<p>Community servers are an important liberty for a game to have. For this reason, the gamemode will be made available to server operators and clients on the Steam Workshop <strong>after</strong> the MDP is complete. The aim is to create an open source platform similar to the way that DarkRP is developed. This creates opportunity for input from many server operators and lua developers to make the gamemode the best it can be, more so than the design from the MDP.</p>

<h3>Impact on the Environment</h3>
<p>The design, being digital by nature, requires working computer systems on both the client and server; these computer systems require <strong>power</strong>. The data transfer over internet or LAN that takes place during a session also involves many electronic components such as routers, modems, switches, telephone exchanges and so on. The clients and server are considered the primary requirements of the design, and their connecting components a secondary requirement that would exist even without the design.</p>
