<h2>Consideration of Design Factors Relevant to the Major Design Project</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr><th style="width:33%;vertical-align:center">Design factor</th> <th style="width:33%">Impact</th> <th style="width:33%">Justification of Relevance</th> </tr></thead>
<tr> <td colspan="3">Appropriateness</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>The gamemode is aimed towards gamers on a budget</td> <td>The target market will not want to have to make any extra purchases.</td> <td>This may place limits or extra burden on the designer to ensure all content is included with the gamemode. If this content is not included in the distribution, some potential players may be turned away because they lack the required files.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td colspan="3">Needs</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>The players need to be entertained by the gameplay</td> <td>If players do not find the game entertaining, it will not gain popularity.</td> <td>If the gamemode does not gain some level of market share by its popularity, it is not a successful as a design. Furthermore, if the gamemode is not fun to play, then since it is only small, there will likely be little reason to continue with playing.</td>
<tr> <td colspan="3">Function</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>The gamemode must be loadable from the game menu</td> <td>If the game does not load, the files that make it up are useless.</td> <td>An unloadable game could never be considered a successful design.</td> 
<tr> <td>The gamemode is being created with a scripting language</td> <td>The level of control over the game engine is limited to the capabilities of the APIs available in the scripting language.</td> <td>If the gamemode were being coded with the native language of the game engine, more fine-grained control could be given to the designer. However, this also results in a greater burden on the programmer which is not justifiable in the MDP.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td colspan="3">Aesthetics</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>The gamemode aims to achieve a consistent aesthetic look in the UI, textures and models</td> <td>A more consistent look to the gamemode will give the user an impression of professionality</td> <td>If the design does not come across as professional, the players will find it less appealing. Appeal is important especially to <em>graphics snobs</em>, the kind who are inclined to play games to enjoy their aesthetic appeal.</td> </tr>
<!-- <tr> <td colspan="3">Finance</td> </tr> -->
<!-- <tr> <td>The game is being produced on a minimal budget</td> <td>The quality of the gamemode has a possibility of decreasing in quality compared if it were produced with professional software. </td> <td></td> -->
<!-- <tr> <td colspan="3">Ergonomics</td> </tr> -->
<!-- <tr> <td colspan="3">Work Health and Safety</td> </tr> -->
<tr> <td colspan="3">Quality</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Gamers expect a certain level of quality</td> <td>If the quality expectations of the players are not met by the gamemode, then they will not be bothered to return to a server regularly.</td> <td>If the gamemode fails to draw players in to start playing, continue playing and return to play, then it is very short-lived in its usefullness. A gamemode with short longevity is not a successful design.</td> </tr>
<!-- <tr> <td colspan="3">Short and long term environmental consequences</td> </tr>
<tr> <td colspan="3">Obsolescence</td> </tr>
<tr> <td colspan="3">Life Cycle Analysis</td> </tr> -->
