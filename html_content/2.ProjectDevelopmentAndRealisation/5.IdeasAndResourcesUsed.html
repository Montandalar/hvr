<h2>Identification and Justification of Ideas and Resources Used</h2>
<h3>Resources Used</h3>
<table>
<thead> <th>Resource</th> <th>Justification</th> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>    <td>Source Engine</td>     <td>Developing a standalone game requires time and skill unavailable in the MDP.</td> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Half-Life Assets</td>  <td>The skill set of the designer is limited to scripting. The use of premade assets allows the design to be facilitated.</td> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Garry's Mod Fonts</td> <td>Keeping a consistent look with other gamemodes is important. Finding one or more fonts also takes time that is better spent coding.</td> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Garry's Mod APIs</td>  <td>The core lua scripting language is extended by the APIs that are included with Garry's mod. These APIs are necessary to deal with the Source engine features and graphics capabilities that the core language lacks.</td> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Garry's Mod Wiki</td>  <td>This wiki is an API reference site that allows a lua scripter to look up hooks, libraries, etc that make up the Garry's Mod APIs. The wiki is a necessity to become familiar with writing lua for Garry's Mod, as well as invaluable in finding the methods needed to script the design.</td> </tr>

<h3>Ideas Used</h3>
<table>
<thead> <th>Idea</th>                      <th>Justification</th> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>    <td>Round-based</td>               <td>This idea is inspired by a wide variety of online multiplayer games that are split into rounds. In particular, the Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode for Garry's Mod uses this style of gameplay. It was thought that this format best facilitated the design goal of being able to enter and exit a game of HvR at any point.</td> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Three bar HUD</td>             <td>This layout for the HUD was taken from The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim. Since my game also uses a system with three major stats, I thought that this HUD would be appropriate.</td> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Not knowing who to trust</td>  <td>The premise of Trouble in Terrorist Town was that none of the innocent would know who the traitors were in a match. The idea introduced in Humans versus Robots that nobody would know anybody's player/robot status was a variation on that idea, which made it possibly more interesting.</td> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Survival game style stats</td> <td>This idea was inspired mostly by the gamemode Garry's Mod Stranded, which had Hunger, Thirst and Fatigue statistics. There are two reasons to include this feature in Humans versus Robots. Firstly, it would help to resolve stalemates that may arise when players hide or refuse to attack each other. Secondly, it helps to differentiate the gamemode further from Trouble in Terrorist Town.</td> </tr>
