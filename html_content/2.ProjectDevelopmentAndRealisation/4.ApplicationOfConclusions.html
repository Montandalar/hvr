<h2>Application of Conclusions</h2>

<h3>Conclusions: Design Specification</h3>
<p>This is the basic list of features that the gamemode needs as a design:</p>
<table>
<thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Justification</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td>Round timer</td> <td>To ensure that the game is complete within a certain time period.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Player classes</td> <td>To divide the players into opposing forces.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Three stat system</td> <td>To force players to take actions in order to replenish the stats, possibly revealing themselves in the process.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Custom HUD</td> <td>Since the gamemode uses custom stats, this requires a new HUD to include this information.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>A map with stat-replenishing elements</td> <td>To satisfy the stats of humans and robots, which requires a map that includes appropriate element such as water sources and energy chargers.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Identifiable corpses</td> <td>Once a player is dead, their human/robot status is revealed. This leads to group-enforced punishments for random kills.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>A means of eliminating other players</td> <td>To satisfy the game objective of eliminating the other team.</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The following flowchart was created to guide the implementation of the gamemode, particularly the round system which is central to the gameplay experience:</p>
<img src="../images/gamemode.svg" style="width:100%;margin-top:5mm">
<p>However, it soon became apparent that this flow chart was inadequate for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It relies solely on specific periods of time between checking certain conditions, but the gamemode would be more efficient to use event-based triggers for such checks, for example only checking the number of connected players when a player connects or disconnects.</li>
<li>It only details the round system in depth but leaves out other important information such as logic for managing players or networking information to the client.</li>
<li>The names of certain variables and script files are subject to change as the gamemode develops and conventions are used, for example player_hvr_human.lua instead of humans.lua</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusions: Development environment</h3>
<p>This is a list of programs that I will use to develop the gamemode:</p>
<table>
<thead> <tr> <th>Program</th> <th>Use of program</th> <th>Reasoning</th> </tr> </thead>
<tr> <td>Notepad++</td> <td>Source code editor</td> <td>The best editor is the editor is the editor of your preference, and I am highly familiar with Notepad++.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>git</td> <td>Source control system</td> <td>The only source control system with which I have experience. Cab easily be hosted on GitHub.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Inkscape</td> <td>Vector graphics editor</td> <td>Free as in freedom license. Useful set of features</td></tr>
<tr> <td>The GIMP</td> <td>Raster graphics editor</td> <td>Same reasoning as Inkscape; raster and vector graphics features combined between the two are useful.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Source map editor: Hammer</td> <td>Creation of map (game level) for the project</td> <td>The only reasonable level editor available for the gamemode.</td> </tr>
</table>
