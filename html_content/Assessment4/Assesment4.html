<h3>Continual evaluation throughout your project</h3>

<h3>Effect of the design on society and the environment</h3>

<h2>Part B: Display</h2>

<h3>Reasoning for the display</h3>
<p>My display aims to replicate the concept of the MDP around the theme of Humans versus Robots, which is best accomplished by presenting the finish work in its environment on a computer system.</p>
<p>The display aims to do at least the following:</p>
<ul><li>Convey the MDP directly to the marker by allowing them to engage with it by playing it.</li>
<li>Provide a suitable space for the marker to view the media content of the folio and the folio in digital form.</li>
<li>Allow the marker to view the git log and source code of the project to validate the authenticity of my work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Needs for the display</h3>
<p>The display needs the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer desk</li>
<li>The following computer peripherals and connectors:</li>
	<ul><li>Monitor</li>
	<li>VGA cable</li>
	<li>Mouse</li>
	<li>Keyboard</li>
	</ul>
<li>Computer for which I have administrative privileges and the following:</li>
	<ul><li>Steam client (this is a prerequisite for Garry's Mod)</li>
	<li>Garry's Mod</li>
	<li>Project Folio in digital form, to be displayed in the web browser</li>
	</ul>
<li>Printed copy of the folio in case the digital folio fails</li>
</ul>
