# Humans versus Robots - a gamemode for Garry's Mod
This was a project for Year 12 Design and Technology. The basic premise is
similar to Trouble in Terrorist town, but with stats that drain over time and
have to be replenished with pickups.

See the GitHub pages at
    http://montandalar.github.io/hvr/html_content/index.html
for a detailed design folio of the project.
